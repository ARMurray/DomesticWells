# Here, we apply the five tests shown in our paper as a way #
# to parse out spatial inaacuracies which may have occured  #
# while reaggregating 1990 & 2000 boundaries to match 2010  #
# Census boundaries.                                        #

# Test #1: (1)	Housing change from 1990 â€“ 2000:  Realistic housing unit density change was 
# determined for block groups between 1990 and 2000 by identifying block groups which maintained 
# the exact same boundaries between census collection years and then finding the range of housing 
# unit density changes for these block groups. Due to the fact that census boundary files for 1990 
# and 2000 are slightly different, block groups were determined to be identical if they had less 
# than .1 percent change in land area between 1990 and 2000.
